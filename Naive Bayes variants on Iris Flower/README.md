# Project#2: 
# Image Processing using Machine Learning

This project is in Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn. It is Supervised Machine Learning based problem. Main goal of this problem was prediction based on given Flower Iris dataset. This data was trained on different Naive Bayes algorithms variants such as Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Complement Naive Bayes and Bernoulli Naive Bayes.Gaussian Naive Bayes alogrithm had the highest accuracy of 93% among the listed variants.


## Steps Performed
- Importing libraries
- Reading and Understanding the Dataset
- Preprocessing the Dataset
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Preparing the data for model building
- Defining the model
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Predicting the test dataset
- Evaluating the model
