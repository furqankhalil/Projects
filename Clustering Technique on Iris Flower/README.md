# Clustering Technique on Iris Flower

This project is in Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn. It is Unsupervised Machine Learning based problem. Main goal of this problem was to predict Different Clusters based on given Iris Flower dataset. This data was trained on K-Means algorithm.
## Concise Steps

- Importing the main libraries.
- Reading and Understanding the Dataset.
- Preprocessing the Dataset.
- Exploratory Data Analysis.
- Preparing the data for model building.
- Using Elbow Method For Optimal Number of Clusters.
- Defining the model.
- Predicting the test dataset.
- Visualizing Predicted Clusters with their Centroids.
