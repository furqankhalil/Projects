# Image Processing Using Machine Learning

This is my project in Machine Learning with Scikit Learn. It is a supervised machine Learning Classification problem. My aim was the prediction based on 20/20 different pictures of male and female actors. I used different Machine Learning Algorithms such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN, SVM, Logistic Regression. I have achieved 75% highest accuracy on the SVM.
## Concise Steps

- Importing the main libraries

- Preprocessing the Dataset
- Preparing the data for model building
- Defining the model
- Hyperparameter tuning.
- Predicting the test dataset
- Evaluating the model
