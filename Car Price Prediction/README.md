# Predicting Car Prices

This is my first project in Machine Learning with Scikit Learn. It is a supervised Machine Learning Regression problem. My aim is to predict the car price given different features. The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle. I have used Random Forest Regressor with RandomizedSearchCV for prediction. I have achieved 95% on the predicted dataset. The model is saved using pickle and deployed using Streamlit.

## Features
- Year Purchased
- Current Price
- Distance Travelled (Km)
- Fuel Type
- Number of Previous Owners
- Transmission Type

## Concise Steps

- Importing the main libraries
- Reading and Understanding the Dataset
- Preprocessing the Dataset
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Preparing the data for model building
- Defining the model
- Hyperparameter tuning using Randomized SearchCV.
- Predicting the test dataset
- Evaluating the model
- Saving the model using Pickle
